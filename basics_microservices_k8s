1. deply the queue. [activemq]
2. deploy the position simulator. - sends the messages/position details to the queue.
   No need for service definition as it doesnt exposes itself.
3. deploy the position tracker.
4. deploy the api-gateway. for testing we can expose the NodePort and then after testing we can remove as we dont want to expose the api-gateway. We will be exposing the frontend to the external world.
5. deploy the frontend.

using mongo with the position-tracker.
